I have experience building sites with React, Next, Vue and am always on the lookout for an excuse to learn a new framework or library! Truth be told, I just love all things programming related. Be it games, cool algorithms to work around specific problems, AI or modding pretty much anything to make it a more personal experience, I constantly find myself fiddling with *some* type of code.

I love nature, the beauty in the different shades of green you can find in trees, plants and even grass and mushrooms made green my favorite color, and there's just something incredibly calming and wholesome about watching something I planted grow up, become a beautiful plant or tree and getting to see them thrive. Touching grass really does go a long way, especially when a significant part of your life is bound to a computer and that logical space within your brain that lets you abstract things into bits and pieces that you can communicate to a computer.",

      "description": "I've been learning programming for about 6 years now, my first real interaction with a code editor was on my first year at Universidad Maimonides, Argentina. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to follow career-wise, so i went for a career that had many aspects I had interest in, such as graphic design, media editing (photoshop, premiere, aftereffects, etc), animation, 3D Modeling, and naturally, programming. This was, however, not even close in terms of how much the different subjects interested me once i actually got to do some hands on learning, as I immediately loved the amount of control I have when coding and just how powerful of a tool a computer is. I can only wonder what someone like Sir Isaac Newton would have been able to accomplish with a computer, and I'm extremely excited to see what I can learn from people who have surpassed my own level some 10, 20 or even 30+ years ago! I'm currently reaping the rewards of my hard work too, The people who have worked with me have all said very encouraging things to me as a professional, and the college I studied in even thought I was good enough to teach at a University. I'm now ready to dive into the world of constant production, with a skillset that doesn't just involve programming, but rather a full fledged Multi-Media professional capable of working with and around all kinds of professionals that involve creating wonderful digital products!",
