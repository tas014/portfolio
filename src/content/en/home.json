      "description": "I've been ¬learning¬ to program for about °6 years° now. My first real interaction with a ¬code editor¬ was on my first year at Universidad Maimonides, Argentina. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to follow career-wise, so i went for a career that had many aspects I had *interest* in, such as ¬graphic design¬, ~media editing~ (photoshop, premiere, aftereffects, etc), ¬animation¬, °3D Modeling°, and naturally, *programming*. This was, however, not even close in terms of how much the different subjects interested me once i actually got to do some hands on learning. I immediately fell in love with the amount of ¬control¬ I have when coding and just how powerful a *tool* a computer is. I can only wonder what someone like Sir Isaac Newton would have been able to accomplish with a computer, and I'm ~extremely excited~ to see what I can learn from my seniors, whom have walked this path some 10, 20 or even 30+ years ago! I'm currently reaping the rewards of my hard work too. The people who have ¬worked with me¬ have all had very encouraging feedback, particularly in regard to my ~communication skills~. I have also been teaching programming at Universidad Maimonides for two years now. I'm now ready to dive into the world of constant ¬production¬, with a *skillset* that doesn't just involve *programming*, but rather the  full fledged knowledge of a ~Multi-Media developer~ capable of working with, and around, all kinds of professionals that involve *creating* wonderful digital ¬products¬!",
